# Unification of Quantum Gravity and Quantum Mechanics: The Objective Collapse of the Wave Function and the Solution to the $\Lambda$ and $m_H$ Crises via the Constitutive Absolute Quantum Phase Field (CAQPF)

## Abstract
The Constitutive Quantum Field Theory (CQFT) resolves the three fundamental crises of modern physics within a unified framework: the cosmological constant ($\mathbf{\Lambda}$), the Higgs mass ($\mathbf{m_H}$), and the quantum measurement problem. We postulate that the background expectation value of the **Constitutive Absolute Quantum Phase Field (CAQPF)** is the **Hidden Modulus ($\mathbf{\phi_{T}}$)**, which sets the observed value of $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ and cancels the $m_{H}$ divergence via a constitutive counterterm. Crucially, the CAQPF's dynamics induce the **Objective Collapse** of the wave function, replacing the *ad hoc* Born's Rule with deterministic physics. We derive the CQFT Lindblad Master Equation and predict a **Critical Collapse Mass** in the mesoscopic range: $M_{cr}\sim10^{9}$ amu. This non-unitary dynamics is governed by the **Principle of Constitutive Inertia (PCI)**, which posits that superposition is energetically unstable. We propose two falsifiable experiments: direct measurement of $M_{cr}$ via nanoparticle interferometry, and detection of the CAQPF's **spectral signature**: an anomalous force noise peak at $f_{T}\approx96.7$ MHz.

## I. INTRODUCTION
The three great anomalies of particle physics and cosmology—the $10^{120}$ disparity between the theoretical and observed value of the Cosmological Constant ($\mathbf{\Lambda}$), the Higgs mass hierarchy problem ($m_{H}$), and the nature of quantum collapse—point towards the incompleteness of the Standard Model and General Relativity. **CQFT** proposes a unified solution by introducing a fundamental scalar field, the **Constitutive Absolute Quantum Phase Field (CAQPF)** whose non-minimal coupling to curvature governs both the spacetime geometry and the quantum dynamics of matter.

## II. CONSTITUTIVE THEORY AND CRISIS RESOLUTION

### Phase Quantum Gravity (PQG) Lagrangian
The PQG action is:
$$
S=\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}[\frac{M_{Pl}^{2}}{2}R-\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\Phi)^{2}-V(\Phi)+\xi R\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi+\frac{\beta}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\chi)^{2}R+\mathcal{L}_{matter}]
$$
Where $\Phi=\rho e^{i\chi}$ is the constitutive field.

### The Cosmological Constant and the Higgs
The value of $\Lambda$ is obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the $\phi_{T}$ field:
$$
\Lambda_{obs}=\langle V(\phi_{T})\rangle\sim\frac{\phi_{T}^{4}}{\hbar c^{3}}
$$
The value of $\phi_{T}$ is predicted by the **Constitutive Theory of Gravity (CTG)** yielding the observable frequency:
$$
f_{T} \approx \frac{c^{2} \sqrt{\Lambda_{obs}}}{2\pi \sqrt{3}} \approx 96.7 \text{ MHz}
$$
The quadratic divergence of $m_{H}$ is canceled by the phase coupling term $\beta$ and the effective curvature counterterm, resolving the hierarchy problem.

## III. OBJECTIVE COLLAPSE AND THE PCI

### Derivation of the Lindblad Master Equation
The effective non-relativistic interaction Hamiltonian leads to the Lindblad Master Equation for the reduced density matrix $\rho(x,x^{\prime},t)$:
$$
\frac{\partial\rho(x,x^{\prime},t)}{\partial t}=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[\hat{H}_{0},\rho]-\Lambda_{CQFT}(x-x^{\prime})^{2}\rho(x,x^{\prime},t)
$$

### Critical Collapse Mass ($M_{cr}$)
The collapse parameter $\Lambda_{CQFT}$ scales with the CAQPF frequency and the Planck hierarchy: $\lambda_{micro}\approx\omega_{T}(\frac{m_{0}}{M_{Pl}})^{2}\sim10^{-30}s^{-1}$. The macroscopic collapse rate ($\Gamma_{macro}$) scales with the square of the mass ($N^{2}$). By setting $\Gamma_{macro}\sim1$ Hz, CQFT predicts the **physically fixed** Critical Collapse Mass:
$$
M_{cr}\sim10^{9} \text{ amu}
$$

### The Principle of Constitutive Inertia (PCI)
The PCI is formalized through a **Constitutive Influence Functional** ($\mathcal{F}_{CQFT}$) in the path integral:
$$
\mathcal{F}_{CQFT}[x,x^{\prime}]=\exp\{-\frac{\Lambda_{CQFT}}{2}\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}(M[x(t^{\prime})]-M[x^{\prime}(t^{\prime})])^{2}\}
$$
The PCI ensures that only classical-like paths ($x\approx x^{\prime}$) contribute significantly to the transition amplitude.

## IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AND PREDICTIONS

| Observable | CSL Model (Phenomenological) | CQFT (Constitutive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mass Limit ($M_{cr}$) | $\sim10^{8}-10^{10}$ amu (free parameter) | $\sim10^{9}$ amu (**fixed by $\Lambda$**) |
| Cause of Collapse | Stochastic Noise Field | **Principle of Constitutive Inertia** ($\phi_{T}$ friction) |
| Noise Spectrum | White Noise (Flat) | **Resonance Peak at 96.7 MHz** |
| Origin of $\Lambda_{cosmo}$ | Irrelevant / Unconnected | $\phi_{T}$ Field Expectation Value (Exact) |

## V. CONCLUSION
The detection of the 96.7 MHz frequency will not only falsify or validate this theory, but will provide the first experimental evidence of the fundamental connection between gravity, quantum mechanics, and the structure of the cosmological vacuum.
